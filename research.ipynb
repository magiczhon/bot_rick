bunch of them got killed too they lost lady katana calypso diablo verde yikes yeah things did feel less diverse in there this article says the reason we weren t involved was personality conflicts don t worry morty they love you superheroes need a wide eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it s mind blowing i think the personality conflict might have been you jesus how awesome is that i mean they wanted to not need me so bad they murdered three innocent heroes of color and they still had to bring me back rick since it s my adventure and all could you do me a favor uh the adventure is the favor morty me sleeping on these linens is the favor i mean w w w what what are we vindicating comfort rick this really bums me out it it s embarrassing to find out these guys don t

monorail man two assholes and a full alligator in like an hour shit check check one two okay is it recording good hello vindicators welcome to your reckoning babyyyyyyyy welp it s official i had too much to drink last night rick what s going on buddy obviously i came here last night during a blackout obviously you came here and defeated our arch nemesis while so drunk you don t remember doing it that s something obvious to you look i m a lit little more complex than you guys and no offense but i ve always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours rick is is this a saw thing are you seriously saw ing the vindicators morty i m a drunk not a hack if you break the rules lose the game or try to leave you will die like in sawwww well i i i think we ve seen enough i ll just figure out how to unplug this screw this i m not playing his game i m gonna find us a way out of here whoa whoa whoa hold on vance he said you d die if you tried to leave that means there s booby traps why are you acting like that s not you what part of blackout don t you understand i thought you drank give me one good reason why i shouldn t crush your windpipe because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh and because like i said i don t remember last night i told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back alan i m not proud of what s happening here but if you keep coming at me there s gonna be another passenger on that ghost train the two of us i hope you re proud of yourself uh i kind of am i saved the goddamn universe that s not the issue rick ahh it would ve been if i hadn t crocubot don t huh i m seeing more croc than bot here oh o okay this again you know i could have made a device to detect doomnomitron from orbit like that i it s just something rick starts talking about whenever he s blackout drunk w what in w in w w what in what way like w w what s my point in a way that has no point you just babble about defense budgets and the united nations and then you pass out so to be clear i sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic which is not the same as going to an anti semitic place i have no stake in this i don t either i i m just saying if anything the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of israel he wants what s best for it and you guys hit the baskets i ll disarm the drunkenly improvised neutrino bomb there s a chance it s a dud but y you should still stay back morty how many of these too many rick too many man i am really getting high roaded today that s a three pointer where the fuck is the lead wire you always put it in the weirdest place um uh over here maybe jesus christ what a shitty neutrino bomb it s a miracle i actually every destroy anything oh i don t know you managed to destroy just about everything today the villains the heroes the lines between them my childhood thank you i appreciate it morty i know you were sucking the kool aid out of the vindicators dicks so the fact that i was right about them must be pretty hard to admit yeah it is you know why rick because when you re an asshole it doesn t matter how right you are nobody wants to give you the satisfaction i know everyone wants people they like to be right that s why popular people are fucking dumb and why your pretentious poorly written high budget friends back there can a eat a double decker shit sandwich disarmed stop oof didn t see that comin is that sarcasm i don t want you slipping away then this is over all of these deaths are on your hands oh come on maybe a couple of them but definitely not the train guy all of them o kayyy jesus okay open to second opinions i could it could be morty what hey i don t know i mean look when i get drunk i get stupid and emotional and there s no logic to it it s like possible i got so drunk i felt like i was losing morty to the vindicators and maybe this is my way of saying okay you can have him but only if you know how important he is otherwise i ll kill you that is a really specific guess look i there s nothing in the room but us i m just using logic to connect some dots it s the best guess i ve got i ll cover that bet i get it well morty i think you re making that smirky face because you re misinterpreting the moment i am not being coy about some hidden love for you i want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess like if i gave you an amulet last night or well morty i think you re making that smirky face because you re misinterpreting the moment i am not being coy about some hidden love for you i want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess like if i gave you an amulet last night or oh shit you re fucking cool and you re smart and i bet we coulda hung out and shit and i hope you get to be a full fledged vindicator a and d do me a favor do don t let him know i i got emotional but you can tell him one thing tell him i said oh fuck okay i just shit myself okay later w dude morty what happened i greater good titty bean it s the galaxy s faith in the vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure yeah i feel safer already no doubt who do we make the check out to i ll say we are gettin some good licks in while choking to death goodbye my love damn she double crossed snuzzles let s give a huge thanks to rick sanchez for killing worldender

ever be rick oh for fuck s sake oh for fuck s sake what are you stupid we re done with the citadel of ricks i was never on board with it in the first place that s why i murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot yeah he knows he murdered them every day every day you don t have to be a dick geez i didn t know there were still ricks and mortys living on the citadel i wonder what their day to day lives are like well you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun fresh self contained adventure to atlantis anyone continuing to explore the citadel is either stupid or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas holy crap slick s wish came true whoa hahaha yeah atlantis baby that was amazing got some of that mermaid puss i m really hoping it wasn t a one off thing and i can see her again by the way hey um still not curious about what might ve happened at that crazy citadel place pssh not at all morty that place will never have any bearing over our lives ever
